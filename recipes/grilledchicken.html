    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil </li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Season chicken breasts with oregano, basil, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken breasts on preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Melt butter with vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic in the butter mixture until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir flour through the butter mixture; cook and stir until flour is incorporated, about 1 minute more. Pour heavy cream and chicken broth into the saucepan; stir. Continue cooking until the mixture thickens, 3 to 5 minutes. Add Parmesan cheese and cream cheese to the saucepan; cook, stirring occasionally, until the cheese is melted into the sauce, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Plate the chicken breasts. Spoon sauce over the chicken. Serve extra sauce on the side.</li>
    </ol>
